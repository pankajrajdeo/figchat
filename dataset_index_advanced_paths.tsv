HLCA_full_superadata_v3_norm_log_deg.h5ad	Supercell bins of 50 cells per bin on the entire h5ad computed at the donor and cell level, reducing 2,282,447 cells to 50,520 metacells . The integrated Human Lung Cell Atlas (HLCA) represents the first large-scale, integrated single-cell reference atlas of the human lung. It consists of over 2 million cells from the respiratory tract of 486 individuals, and includes 49 different datasets. It is split into the HLCA core, and the extended or full HLCA. The HLCA core includes data of healthy lung tissue from 107 individuals, and includes manual cell type annotations based on consensus across 6 independent experts, as well as demographic, biological and technical metadata. The datasets in the HLCA core were integrated using scANVI. The HLCA core can be used as a reference to map new datasets onto using scArches. The full HLCA includes 35 further datasets that include donors with various lung diseases. These datasets were mapped onto the core with scArches, and include disease annotations as well as cell type annotations transferred from the HLCA core onto the mapped datasets. Note that while the the HLCA includes an integrated, batch-correctd low-dimensional embedding, the gene counts themselves were not batch-corrected.  Detailed information about all metadata in the objects, as well as further HLCA-related information , can be found on the HLCA landing page: https://github.com/LungCellAtlas/HLCA. Raw counts are available in the downloaded .h5ad at adata.raw.X, in the downloaded .rds at seurat_object@assays$RNA@counts, and via CELLxGENE Census.

BPD_infant_Sun_normalized_log_deg.h5ad	Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease characterized by alveolar dysplasia in newborns that are typically born prematurely. In this study, single-nucleus RNA-Sequencing was performed on BDPD infants (n=15) and age matched controls (n=8) who died from complications associated with BPD (4 months to 3 years of age).

BPD_fetal_normalized_log_deg.h5ad	Lung injury in preterm infants leads to structural and functional respiratory deficits, with a risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) that in its most severe form is accompanied by pulmonary hypertension (PH). To examine cellular and molecular dynamics driving evolving BPD in humans, single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on preterm infant lungs in early stages of BPD and BPD+PH compared to term infants. Analysis of the endothelium revealed a unique aberrant capillary cell-state primarily in BPD+PH marked by ANKRD1 expression. Predictive signaling analysis identified deficits in the semaphorin guidance-cue signaling pathway and decreased expression of pro-angiogenic transcription factor FOXF1 within the alveolar parenchyma in neonatal lung samples with BPD/BPD+PH.
